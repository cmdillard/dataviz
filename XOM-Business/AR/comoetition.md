Yes — both Chevron Corporation (through its affiliate Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, or CPChem) and Shell plc (via its chemicals / polymers business) **do** have business lines that resemble ExxonMobil’s “Advanced Recycling” plastics-circularity unit — but there are important caveats in terms of scale, ambition, and technical maturity.

Here’s a breakdown:

---

### ExxonMobil  
First, to anchor reference: ExxonMobil has a clearly defined “Advanced Recycling” business line (chemical recycling of plastics) that aims to convert used plastics into raw materials for new plastics and chemicals.  [oai_citation:0‡ExxonMobil](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/what-we-do/materials-for-modern-living/our-commitment-to-advanced-recycling?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
Key points:  
- They describe converting hard-to-recycle plastics (films, multilayer packaging, etc) via advanced recycling (chemical/pyrolysis/other) into feedstocks for new virgin-quality plastics.  [oai_citation:1‡baytownrefinery.us](https://baytownrefinery.us/what-we-do/materials-for-modern-living/advanced-recycling-plastic-waste-exxonmobil.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- They have announced capacity expansion goals (e.g., 1 billion pounds per year global by ~2027) for advanced recycling.  [oai_citation:2‡ExxonMobil](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/what-we-do/materials-for-modern-living/our-commitment-to-advanced-recycling?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- They treat it as a business unit or growth platform tied to their Materials / “Modern Living” plastics & chemicals business.  

So for comparison, the question is: do Chevron and Shell have a similar “business line/segment” aimed at advanced recycling of plastics?

### Chevron / Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem)  
Yes — Chevron (via CPChem) has a notable advanced recycling / circular-plastics feedstock business. Some of the evidence:

- CPChem in its “Product Sustainability & Circularity” materials describes “Advanced Recycling and Feedstocks of the Future” and acknowledges using advanced recycling (also called chemical recycling) to transform difficult-to-recycle plastics into new feedstocks and circular products.  [oai_citation:3‡Sustainability Report](https://sustainability-report.cpchem.com/2023/product-sustainability-and-circularity/advanced-recycling-and-feedstocks-of-the-future.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- CPChem produced “Marlex® Anew™ Circular Polyethylene” which is a commercially launched product made from feedstocks derived from advanced recycling / pyrolysis oil of hard-to-recycle plastics.  [oai_citation:4‡CNG](https://cnginc.com/chevron-phillips-chemical-and-charter-next-generation-to-bring-circular-polyethylene-to-retail-stores/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- CPChem secured a long-term supply agreement with an advanced recycling company (Nexus Circular LLC) to supply advanced-recycled feedstocks.  [oai_citation:5‡PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chevron-phillips-chemical-deepens-collaboration-with-nexus-circular-securing-contracted-long-term-supply-of-advanced-recycled-plastic-feedstocks-from-new-facility-301737901.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

So yes — Chevron’s chemical/plyer business has a line of advanced recycling/circularity feedstock and product offering. Some distinctions relative to ExxonMobil:

- While ExxonMobil appears to emphasize the “Advanced Recycling” unit (e.g., large-scale built facility, explicit goal of 1 billion pounds per year) as a growth driver, CPChem’s advanced recycling is more narrowly positioned as part of its circular‐product feedstocks initiative rather than a stand-alone large business segment.  
- The scale and number of facilities may be smaller (or at least less publicly detailed) compared to Exxon’s big announcements.  
- CPChem ties advanced recycling into its olefins/polyolefins business by offering circular polyethylene products.

Hence: Chevron/CPChem **does** have a business line similar in intent to Exxon’s advanced recycling — converting difficult plastics waste into feedstocks for new plastics — though the scale and strategic framing may differ.

### Shell  
Shell also has activity in chemical/advanced recycling of plastics, but with more caveats and signs of scaling back.

Evidence for Shell:

- On Shell’s website (Shell Chemicals), there is a section titled “Chemical recycling: tackling plastic waste.” It describes the process of using plastic waste that is hard to mechanically recycle (e.g., multi‐layer packaging, films) and turning it via pyrolysis into “pyrolysis oil” feedstock to be used in their chemical plants for new plastics/chemicals.  [oai_citation:6‡Shell](https://www.shell.com/business-customers/chemicals/chemical-recycling-tackling-plastic-waste.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Shell acknowledges that chemical/advanced recycling technologies are still at nascent stage and need scaling.  [oai_citation:7‡ERT](https://ert.eu/innovation/stories/shell/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- However, there is reporting that Shell has **backed away** from its previously more aggressive target of converting 1 million tonnes per year of plastic waste into pyrolysis oil by 2025, citing feedstock/technology/regulation challenges.  [oai_citation:8‡Plastics Today](https://www.plasticstoday.com/advanced-recycling/shell-walks-back-chemical-recycling-project?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

Thus: Shell has a business line (or at least a business initiative) in advanced/chemical recycling of plastics, but it may not be as fully embraced or as scaled/announced as Exxon’s unit. It has a similar objective (convert hard-to-recycle plastics into feedstock for chemical production) but its strategic emphasis appears more limited and under some revision.

### Summary: direct answer  
- **Yes**, Chevron (through CPChem) *does* have a business line analogous to ExxonMobil’s advanced recycling business: converting plastic waste into feedstocks for new plastics (circular polymers) and offering new products such as circular polyethylene.  
- **Yes**, Shell also *has* a business initiative in chemical/advanced recycling of plastics, but it is less clearly positioned as a large standalone business line and appears to have scaled back some of its ambition.  
- **However**, neither Chevron nor Shell seems to exactly replicate the scale, corporate prominence or naming convention of ExxonMobil’s “Advanced Recycling” business unit. The strategic prominence, capital investment, or public commitments differ.

If you like, I can pull together a comparative table of each company’s advanced recycling/circular-plastics business: scale, announced capacity, feedstock types, strategic significance, and risks. Would that be helpful?
